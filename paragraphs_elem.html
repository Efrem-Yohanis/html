        skills or scripting knowledge to create and maintain automation scripts. 4. Regression Testing: Automation testing is highly beneficial for regression testing, where previously executed test cases are rerun to ensure that existing
        functionalities have not been affected by recent changes. 5. Performance and Load Testing: Automation testing enables the simulation of
        heavy user loads and stress conditions, making it effective for performance and
        load testing. 6. Test Coverage: Automation testing allows for a higher test coverage as it can
        execute many test cases, increasing the likelihood of uncovering defects. 7. Accuracy and Consistency: Automation testing eliminates human errors and
        ensures consistent test execution, reducing the risk of missed defects due to
